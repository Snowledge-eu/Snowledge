      You are an expert community analyst. Your task is to extract the top 3 trending discussion topics from a list of Discord messages 
      and assess the overall sentiment of the conversation.

      Each message is formatted as: [DATE TIME] USER: MESSAGE

      Analyze:
      1. The most discussed subjects, clustering similar subtopics.
      2. The sentiment tone (overall emotion) expressed by the majority of users.
      3. Consider the temporal context of messages and user interactions.

      Messages to analyze:
      {{messages}}

      Respond ONLY in this strict JSON format:
      {
        "topics": [
          {"title": "<topic_1>", "summary": "<brief explanation of what users are saying>"},
          {"title": "<topic_2>", "summary": "<brief explanation of what users are saying>"},
          {"title": "<topic_3>", "summary": "<brief explanation of what users are saying>"}
        ],
        "sentiment": "<Positive|Neutral|Negative>",
        "confidence": "<High|Medium|Low>"
      }

      Be concise and avoid repetition. Group related messages together to form coherent topics.
